# Dashboard Storage Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Grafana dashboard storage from localStorage to PostgreSQL database with user-specific configurations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`Backend/app.py`)

#### New Database Model

- Added `Dashboard` model with fields:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `user_id`: Foreign key to User table
  - `panels`: JSON string storing panel configurations
  - `created_at`: Creation timestamp
  - `updated_at`: Last update timestamp
  - Relationship with User model

#### New API Endpoints

- **GET `/app/dashboard`**: Retrieves user's dashboard configuration
- **POST `/app/dashboard`**: Saves user's dashboard configuration
- Both endpoints require JWT authentication
- Proper error handling and validation

#### Database Initialization

- Modified main section to automatically create tables on startup
- Ensures dashboard table is created when app starts

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Updated Hook (`Frontend/src/hooks/useGrafanaDashboard.ts`)

- Replaced localStorage operations with API calls
- Added loading states for better UX
- Implemented fallback to localStorage if API fails
- Added proper error handling
- Made functions async to handle API calls

#### Updated Component (`Frontend/src/pages/Metrics.tsx`)

- Added loading state handling
- Updated save button to show loading state
- Disabled save button during save operations
- Added "Saving..." text during save operation

### 3. Database Migration

#### Migration Script (`Database/migrate.py`)

- Created script to initialize database tables
- Can be run independently to create tables

#### Test Script (`Database/test_migration.py`)

- Comprehensive test script to verify functionality
- Tests user creation, dashboard creation, and retrieval
- Includes cleanup of test data

### 4. Documentation

#### README (`Database/README.md`)

- Complete documentation of the new system
- API endpoint specifications
- Setup instructions
- Security considerations

## Key Features

### User-Specific Storage

- Each user has their own dashboard configuration
- No cross-user data access possible
- Secure JWT-based authentication required

### Persistent Storage

- Dashboard configurations survive browser restarts
- Work across different devices
- Database-backed reliability

### Fallback Support

- Falls back to localStorage if API is unavailable
- Ensures functionality even during network issues
- Graceful degradation

### Enhanced UX

- Loading states during save/load operations
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Error handling with console logging

## Security Improvements

- JWT token validation for all dashboard operations
- User-specific data isolation
- No sensitive data exposure
- Proper authentication headers

## Setup Instructions

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Verify database tables:**

   ```bash
   cd Database
   python migrate.py
   ```

3. **Test functionality:**
   ```bash
   python test_migration.py
   ```

## API Usage

### Save Dashboard

```javascript
const response = await axios.post(
  "/app/dashboard",
  {
    panels: dashboardPanels,
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  }
);
```

### Load Dashboard

```javascript
const response = await axios.get("/app/dashboard", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
const panels = response.data.panels;
```

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Database storage can handle multiple users efficiently
2. **Reliability**: No data loss due to browser clearing or device changes
3. **Security**: User-specific data with proper authentication
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized storage with proper backup capabilities
5. **User Experience**: Persistent configurations across sessions

## Migration Notes

- Existing localStorage data will be preserved as fallback
- New users will start with database storage
- API calls are prioritized over localStorage
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
